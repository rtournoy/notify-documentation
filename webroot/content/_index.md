This website documents community conventions in the use of W3C [Linked Data Notifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-ldn-20170502/) (LDN) to integrate repository systems with relevant services in a distributed, resilient and web-native architecture..

The documentation specifies:

* *[Notification Patterns](/patterns/)* (templates) which describe the payload for re-usable notifications. These notifications describe the individual LDNs sent between repositories and services, one or more of which may be used in a *scenario*. A given *notification* is defined in the context of a *scenario*, and uses a *pattern*.

* *[Scenarios](/scenarios/)* which describe example operations, typically involving a repository system and one other service. These operations are enabled by the exchange of *notifications*.

* *[Vocabularies](/vocabularies/)* which are used to provide values for certain properties in the notification payloads.
